Virtual Tape Player

This is a simple app to read an audio file.
I have started to design that to load software on my amstrad CPS 6128 using the Tape port.
I think that usiong a Pc is more convienient that an sandalone MP3 player 
It will have an retro interface that imitate a classy audio tape player.

This software is using Windows Media Player as the audio playback engine.
